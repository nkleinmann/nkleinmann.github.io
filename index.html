                    <p>My name is Nicole Kleinmann and I am currently a Math Content Developer at Mathspace. Prior to working at Mathspace, I was a High School Math and Computer Science teacher for four years.  
                    I am passionate about education (specifically math and computer science) and web development (currently in a UNH Coding Bootcamp). Outside of work I love running or doing anything outside, playing the piano, and traveling.</p>
